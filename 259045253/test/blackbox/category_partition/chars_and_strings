# This tries to test the lexer and check if it is able to parse string and
# char values. So the possible states for the lexer to be in are more than
# what this test aims to test. In particular this test tries to test the
# `_read_char_string` method of the `Lexer` and the `parse_char` and
# `parse_string` methods of the `Parser`
